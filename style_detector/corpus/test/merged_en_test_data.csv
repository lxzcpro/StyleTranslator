Collisions resulting in fragmentation are important in shaping the mass spectrum of minor bodies in the asteroid belt the Kuiper belt and debris disks Models of fragmentation cascades typically find that in steady-state the solution for the particle mass distribution is a power law in the mass However previous studies have typically assumed that the mass of the largest fragment produced in a collision with just enough energy to shatter the target and disperse half its mass to infinity is directly proportional to the target mass,en,science
How can we characterize those planets and assess if they are habitable?

We find that the energy exchanges are essentially direct (from large to small scale) whereas some non linear interactions appear to be non local in spectral space We speculate that these non local interactions are responsible for the correlation between turbulent transport and molecular dissipation We argue that this correlation should then disappear when a significant scale separation is achieved and we discuss several methods by which one can test this hypothesis,en,science

TrES-2 also falls in the category of highly irradiated planets which have been theoretically predicted to exhibit thermal inversions However more observations at infrared and visible wavelengths would be needed to confirm a thermal inversion in this system Furthermore we find that the times of the secondary eclipses are consistent with previously published times of transit and the expectation from a circular orbit,en,science

The rate of migration depends on the temperature of the background gas so a grain distribution that is effectively stable for low temperatures can undergo an irreversible change in opacity if the gas is temporarily heated to above $\sim 150$\ K We find that the opacity can drop more and at a significantly faster rate throughout the spiral shocks relative to the prediction of standard dust grains models adopted in hydrodynamical calculations of protoplanetary disks,en,science

the cooling rates of chondrules are 10-1000 K/hr The reduction in the otherwise rapid cooling rates attributable to line cooling is due to a combination of factors including buffering due to hydrogen recombination/dissociation high column densities of water and backwarming Our model demonstrates that the shock model for chondrule formation remains consistent with observational constraints,en,science

The Kepler Mission was launched on March 6 2009 to perform a photometric survey of more than 100 000 dwarf stars to search for terrestrial-size planets with the transit technique Follow-up observations of planetary candidates identified by detection of transit-like events are needed both for identification of astrophysical phenomena that mimic planetary transits and for characterization of the true planets and planetary systems found by Kepler,en,science
To obtain a firm result two more transit windows were observed and a global Bayesian analysis of the three IRAC time series and the HARPS radial velocities was performed Unfortunately any transit of the planet during the observed phase window is firmly discarded while the probability that the planet transits but that the eclipse was missed by our observations is nearly negligible (0,en,science
The two-decade spread in accretion rates among T Tauri stars is too large to result solely from variety in the grain size and stellar X-ray luminosity but can be produced by varying these together with the disk magnetic flux The diversity in the silicate bands can come from the coupling of grain settling to the distribution of the magneto-rotational turbulence,en,science
TWA22AB is likely to be a astrometric calibrator that can be used to test evolutionary predictions Among our complete sample a total of 65 targets observed with deep coronagraphic imaging About 240 faint candidates were detected around 36 stars Follow-up observations VLT or HST for 83% of these stars enabled us to identify a fraction of contaminants,en,science
the plage contribution due to the convective blueshift attenuation dominates the total signal with an amplitude over the solar cycle of about 8-10 m/s This contribution is very strongly correlated with the Ca index on the long term which may be a way to distinguish between stellar activity and a planet,en,science
The observations of Mars by the CRISM and OMEGA hyperspectral imaging spectrometers require correction for photometric atmospheric and thermal effects prior to the interpretation of possible mineralogical features in the spectra Here we report on a simple yet non-trivial adaptation to the commonly-used volcano-scan correction technique for atmospheric CO_2 which allows for the improved detection of minerals with intrinsic absorption bands at wavelengths between 1,en,science

We show that the gas giant exoplanet HD 189733b is less oblate than Saturn based on Spitzer Space Telescope photometry of seven transits The observable manifestations of oblatenesswould have been slight anomalies during the ingress and egress phases as well as variations in the transit depth due to spin precession,en,science
We find in several cases that such variations should be detectable In particular the estimated period changes for WASP-18b are of the same order as those expected for tidal dissipation even for relatively low values of the tidal dissipation parameter The transit time variations caused by the Applegate mechanism are also of the correct magnitude and occur on timescales such that they may be confused with variations caused by light-time travel effects due to the presence of a Jupiter-like second planet,en,science
At a given time the relative change in semi-major axis of the outer-most embryo in these simulations is found to be essentially independent of a_{crit} and we note that little further embryo migration takes place beyond 10^7 years We conclude that the suppression of runaway growth outside a_{crit} does not mean that the habitable zones in such tight binary systems will be devoid of detectable,en,science
Long-period transiting exoplanets provide an opportunity to study the mass-radius relation and internal structure of extrasolar planets Their studies grant insights into planetary evolution akin to the Solar System planets which in contrast to hot Jupiters are not constantly exposed to the intense radiation of their parent stars Observations of secondary eclipses allow investigations of exoplanet temperatures and large-scale exo-atmospheric properties,en,science
