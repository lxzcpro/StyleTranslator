Each simulation consists of a small number of gravitationally interacting oligarchs and a much larger number of small bodies that represent the natal disk of planetesimals We investigate systems with varying initial number of oligarchs oligarch spacing location of the ice line total mass in the ice line and oligarch mean density,en,science
This calls for the continued exploration of the second largest planet in our Solar System with a variety of means including remote observations and space missions Measurements of gravity and magnetic fields very close to the planet&#39;s cloud tops would be extremely valuable Very high spatial resolution images of the rings would provide details on their structure and the material that form them,en,science
eccentricity and of the radial transversal and normal components of the gas flow velocity vector at the pericentre of the particle&#39;s orbit constitute a system of equations that determines the evolution of the particle&#39;s orbit in space with respect to the gas flow velocity vector This system of differential equations can be easily solved analytically,en,science
We present radial-velocity sequences acquired during three transits of the exoplanet HD 189733b and one transit of the CoRoT-3b We applied a combined Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis of spectroscopic and photometric data on these stars to determine a full set of system parameters including the project spin-orbit misalignement angle of HD 189733b to an unprecedented precision via the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect,en,science
We present three transits of GJ 1214b observed as part of the Apache Point Observatory Survey of Transit Lightcurves of Exoplanets (APOSTLE) We used APOSTLE r-band lightcurves in conjunction with previously gathered data of GJ 1214b to re-derive system parameters By using parameters such as transit duration and ingress/egress length we are able to reduce the degeneracies between parameters in the fitted transit model,en,science
